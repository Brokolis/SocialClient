# SocialClient
A GUI for [DannySMc's](https://github.com/dannysmc95) [SocialNet API](https://github.com/dannysmc95/SocialNet)

## Bedrock
This program was created using [Oeed's](https://github.com/oeed) [Bedrock framework](https://github.com/oeed/Bedrock) (build 548).

## My first program incorporating other's code
SocialClient is my first program which uses other ComputerCrafter's written code (Bedrock). This is my first program created using Bedrock framework. Although, I did write the Lua-side API for SocialNet for my own ease of use.
